             <p>Hi! I'm a recent graduate. Found the love of programming during my second semester and it's been history since. Since then, I've learned so much about the field. I'm currently working at The Knowledge House as a teacher assistant. I have hopes of becoming a professional developer, and eventually start my own company providing a useful service for people.<br><br>I believe I should be accepted into the program because I love to learn. I also love to challenge myself because it helps me grow as an individual. With the knowledge I gain, I like to help people. It's said, when you can explain a topic to someone in simple terms, you now understand it. Entrance into this program would allow me to continue growing. Besides that, you'll get a pretty awesome student in return :P </p>
